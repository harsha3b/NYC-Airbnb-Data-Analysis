In this notebook, we will take a look at the NYC Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx.

We will be working with three datasets:

"datasets/airbnb_price.csv"

"datasets/airbnb_room_type.xlsx"

"datasets/airbnb_last_review.tsv"

Our goals are to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:

# What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
# How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
# How many adverts are for private rooms?
# How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?
